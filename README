Buy The Deal is a website that a friend and I created for a pair programming project in a web development course I took at Illinois State.   The purpose of the project was to create a daily deal website that would host a different deal every day (ex. Groupon).


The following technologies were used in the creation of the website:
JSF
JPA
FLASH
ActionScript 2
JavaScript
JAVA
SQL
JAVA Mail
JSF Timed Auto Redirect
AJAX
Web Services (WSDL)
GlassFish Server

To understand the basic functions of the web site, view the Use Case Outline document for screenshots and brief descriptions.
